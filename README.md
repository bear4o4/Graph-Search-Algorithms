## Graph Search Algorithms
This project implements various graph search algorithms in Python, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) for solving the N-Queens problem.  

## Algorithms Implemented

## 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph. It explores nodes level by level using a queue data structure.  

## 2. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
UCS is used to find the least-cost path in a weighted graph. It uses a priority queue to expand nodes with the lowest path cost first.

## 3. Depth-First Search (DFS) for N-Queens Problem
DFS is used to solve the N-Queens problem using a stack-based approach. It places N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
